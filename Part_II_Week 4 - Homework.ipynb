    "Write the continuous time habit model with utility\n",

    "and\n",
    "\n",
    "$ds_t = (1-\\phi)(\\bar{s}-s_t ) dt + \\lambda(s_t)(dc_t - g dt)$\n",

    "where\n",
    "$$dc_t=gd_t+\\sigma dz_t$$\n",
    "$$st=log\\frac{C_t−X_t}{C_t}$$\n",
    "(This is slightly different from the continuous time model I wrote in the lecture overheads notes. Use this one. I made the notation more similar to the paper here.)\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll redo some of the simple calculations of the paper in continuous time. This gives you a review of the model and some practice with continuous time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The discount factor is\n",
    "$\\Lambda_t = e^{-\\rho t}(C_t-X_t)^{-\\gamma}= e^{-\\rho t}C_t^{-\\gamma}S_t^{-\\gamma}=e^{-\\rho t - \\gamma(c_t+s_t)}$\n",
    "Find $\\frac{d\\Lambda_t}{\\Lambda_t}$ via Ito's lemma. Then, find $r^f_tdt=−E_t\\frac{d\\Lambda_t}{\\Lambda_t}$. Leave your expression in terms of a generic $\\lambda(s)$. Compare your expression to equation (8), p.212 of the paper,\n",

    "$r^f_t = \\rho + \\gamma g - \\gamma(1-\\phi)(s_t - \\bar{s}) - \\frac{\\gamma^2 \\sigma^2}{2} \\left[1 + \\lambda(s_t)\\right]^2 \\; \\; \\; (8) \\\\\n",
    "(\\rho=−ln(\\delta).)$\n",

    "The larger issue we're after here is whether the the model will work the same way in continuous time as in discrete time, in particular whether the choice\n",
    "$\\lambda(s_t) = \\frac{1}{\\bar{S}}  \\sqrt{1 - 2 (s_t-\\bar{s})} -1$\n",
    "$\\bar{S} = \\sigma \\sqrt{\\frac{\\gamma}{1-\\phi}}$\n",
    "will still produce a constant risk free rate. You do not need to plug this functional form to answer the question, however. \n",
    "\n",
    ">**Answer: The continuous-time expression is exactly the same as (8), so the usual $\\lambda(s)$ function will work in continuous time. **\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "####Question 2\n",
    "Next, let's find the continuous time equivalent to equation (7), p. 211. From your expression for $d\\Lambda/\\Lambda$, calculate the maximum Sharpe ratio $\\sigma(d\\Lambda/\\Lambda)$. Compare your formula to the discrete-time approximation given in equation (7) p. 211,\n",
    "$\\frac{E_t(R^e_{t+1})}{\\sigma_t(R^e_{t+1})} \\le \\gamma \\sigma \\left[ 1+ \\lambda(s_t)\\right].$\n",
    "Your formula should, like the discrete time version, be declining in st. To evaluate your formula, what is the limit of your formula as st→smax? As s→smax, the maximum Sharpe ratio....\n",

    "Notes and reminders: From\n",

    "smax is defined as the point where $\\lambda(smax)=0$. Figure 1a p. 215 plots $\\lambda(st)$, and Figure 6 p. 223 presents the exact discrete-time Sharpe ratio bound, the middle term of equation (7) p. 211. But your formula will be exact in continuous time too. \n",

    "####Question 3\n",
    "This problem explores the difference between internal and external habits in a very simple environment. We'll assume perfect foresight -- no Et terms -- and $\\beta=1/Rf$. The consumer has utility with one-period habit formation.\n",
    "$$U = \\sum \\beta^t u\\left(C_t - \\theta C_{t-1}\\right)$$\n",
    "or, near time $t$,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$U = ...  \\beta^{t-1} u\\left(C_{t-1} - \\theta C_{t-2}\\right) \n",
    " +\\beta^{t} u\\left(C_{t} - \\theta C_{t-1} \\right)\n",
    "+\\beta^{t+1} u\\left(C_{t+1} - \\theta C_{t} \\right)+...$$\n",
    "Now, we compute the marginal utility of consumption at time $t$. With external habit, we ignore the presence of $\\theta C_t$ in utility at time $t+1$. (More formally, $\\theta C_t$ represents aggregate consumption over which the investor has no control. ) Thus, the external-habit marginal utility of consumption at time $t$ is\n",
    "$$MU(C_t) = \\frac{\\partial U(C_t)}{\\partial C_t} = u'(C_t - \\theta C_{t-1})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "and the riskfree rate equation is\n",
    "$$MU(C_t) = MU(C_{t+1})$$\n",
    "$$u'(C_t - \\theta C_{t-1}) = u'(C_{t+1} - \\theta C_{t}) \\; \\;  (*)$$\n",
    "(Remember, $\\beta R^f=1$, and perfect foresight.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's do the same thing with internal habits. In this case, the investor recognizes that consumption today will influence habits in the future. So, take the derivative of the utility function with respect to $C_t$, including all places where $C_t$ appears. You should see a \"strategic\" term whereby the consumer thinks about how consumption today affects habits in the future. Calculate $MU(C_t)$ and $MU(C_{t+1})$, and express the first order condition corresponding to (*).\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, suppose the consumption process $\\{C_t\\}$ satisfies the external-habit first-order condition (*) in this case. Does that consumption process also satisfy the internal-habit first order condition that you just derived? \n",
    "\n",
    ">**Answer: Any consumption process that solves the external-habit first order conditions (*) also solves the internal-habit first order conditions. **\n",
    "\n",
    "#####Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a one-period external-habit model with quadratic utility,\n",
    "$u(C) = -0.5 \\left[C^*-(C_t - \\theta C_{t-1})\\right]^2$\n",
    "with $\\beta=1/R^f$ and a constant risk free rate $R^f$. With θ=0, we find that consumption is a random walk,\n",
    "$u'(C_t)=E_tu'(C_{t+1}) \\rightarrow E_t(\\Delta C_{t+1}) = 0; \\; \\Delta C_{t+1} \\equiv C_{t+1}-C_t.$\n",
    "Find the corresponding characterization for the time-series process of $\\delta C_t$ and answer the question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuition will help. If consumption is growing from yesterday to today, that means habits are growing from today to tomorrow. What should this to do consumption, if the investor can borrow and save at $R$? \n",
    "\n",
    ">**Answer: $\\Delta C_t$ now follows an $AR(1)$, with positive autocorrelation. **\n",
    "\n",
    "####Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursive utility looks mighty mysterious. Let's work out a two-period example which will help us to understand how it works. The utility function is defined as in lecture,\n",
    "$$U_t = \\left[ (1-\\beta) C_t^{1-\\rho} + \\beta \\left[ E_t \\left( U_{t+1}^{1-\\gamma} \\right) \\right] ^{\\frac{1-\\rho}{1-\\gamma}} \\right] ^{\\frac{1}{1-\\rho}}$$\n",
    "To make a two-period model, start with $U_{t+2}=0$. Then find $U_{t+1}$, and finally find an expression for $U_t$. You're looking for $U_t$ on the left, and $C_t$, $C_{t+1}$ and parameters on the right, i.e. the generalization of\n",
    "$U_t = C_t^{1-\\gamma} + \\beta E_t \\left[C_{t+1}^{1-\\gamma}\\right]$\n",
    "Pick the right answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have deleted a constant involving $(1−\\beta)$ that multiplies the utility function -- you can always rescale utility by any constant. Assume $\\rho \\neq 1$. One can handle that limit, but it's not worth going through the algebra here. \n",
    "\n",
    ">**Answer: $U_t = \\left[  C_t^{1-\\rho} \n",
    "+ \\beta \\left[ E_t \\left( C_{t+1}^{1-\\gamma} \\right) \\right] ^{\\frac{1-\\rho}{1-\\gamma}} \\right] ^{\\frac{1}{1-\\rho}}$**\n",
    "\n",
    "####Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "The general recursive utility function is \"non-state separable.\" What this means: expected utility $E[u(C)]=\\Sigma_s\\pi(s)u[C(s)]$ is additively separable across states. The overall utility is a sum of sub-utility functions of utility in each state. Does your two-period example still have the state-separability property -- can it be written (perhaps after monotone transformation) as above? \n",
    "\n",
    ">**Answer: No, as long as $C_t$ enters the utility function and for general values of $\\rho$ and $\\gamma$, the time t+1 term cannot be made state-separable. **\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "####Question 7\n",
    "Now, find the basic asset pricing equation in this two period model. Take $\\partial U)t/\\partial C_t$, and then $\\partial U_t/\\partial C_{t+1}$. In the latter, remember you are really taking $\\partial U_t/\\partial C_{t+1}(s)$ in one state $s$. Writing the expectation out as a sum may help you to get that right. Then write the basic asset pricing equation, $p_t \\partial U_t/ \\partial C_t = E_t \\left[ \\partial U_t / \\partial C_{t+1} x_{t+1}\\right]$, i.e. the equation that generalizes $p_t C_t^{-\\gamma} = \\beta E_t \\left[ C_{t+1}^{-\\gamma} x_{t+1} \\right]$\n",
    "\n",
    "(Yes, that's still the asset pricing equation. You can reason either by the usual $\\chi$ purchase of the asset, or that there is a discount factor/contingent claims price $\\Lambda$ and marginal utility equals contingent claims price.) \n",
    "\n",
    ">**Answer: $p_t C_t^{-\\rho}  = \\beta \\left[ E_t ( C_{t+1}^{1-\\gamma})\\right] ^ \\frac{\\gamma-\\rho}{1-\\gamma} E_t \\left[ C_{t+1}^{-\\gamma} x_{t+1} \\right]$** \n",
    "\n",
    ">The first $E_t$ term comes out of the expectation. So recursive utility here only affects the interest rate. Risk premiums are driven entirely by the conventional second term. That's a more general result. The point is to separate EIS from risk aversion. Risk aversion then is pretty standard power utility stuff. This does have deeper effects in dynamic models, since today's consumption won't reveal future news (that's EIS stuff) as it did before. But fundamentally, that's why recursive utility models have to add one of the usual suspects like time varying consumption volatility (or habits? We can mix them!) to generate a time-varying risk premium. But I'm getting ahead of myself, let's go see these things in a bit more detail. \n",
    "\n",
    "####Question 8\n",
    "Suppose that consumption tomorrow is not stochastic, there is only one value Ct+1. Find the risk free rate in this circumstance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is of the form\n",
    "$R^f=\\frac{1}{\\beta}(C_t+\\frac{1}{C_t})x$\n",
    "\n",
    ">**Answer: $R^f = \\frac{1}{\\beta}  \\left( \\frac{C_{t+1}}{C_t}\\right)^{\\rho}$**\n",
    "\n",
    "####Question 9\n",
    "Finally, find the generalization of the power utility formula for pricing excess returns,\n",
    "$0 =  E_t \\left[ \\left(\\frac{C_{t+1}}{C_t}\\right)^{-\\gamma} R^e_{t+1} \\right]$\n",
    "To find this formula, use your general expression with $p_t=1$ and $x_{t+1}=R_{t+1}$. Then subtract for any two assets (including, but not limited to $R_f$) \n",
    "\n",
    ">**Answer: $0\n",
    " = \n",
    "E_t \\left[ \\left(\\frac{C_{t+1}}{C_t}\\right)^{-\\gamma} R^e_{t+1} \\right]$**\n",
    "\n",
    ">This just emphasizes the point that $\\gamma$ handles risk aversion, $\\rho$ handles intertemporal substitution. "
